# genRelevanceCurvers
 This project contains the code to generate the relevance curves and statistics
 for model predictions. It gives explanations for the model predictions. The model
 is specifically done for AlexNet and LeNet Architecture, but can be updated for
 other models


 1. extract_features.py - This file is used to generate the relevances or activations
 for all layers of the model architecture and stored in distinct files

 2. genRelStatistics.py - This is the main file which reads the top relevances or
 activations of the layers and passes it to a function to generate the explanations.

 3. libGenRelStatistics.py - This is the file which uses the parameters generated by
 extract_features.py and genRelStatistics.py and processes them to give explanations
 either in terms of graphs or numerical data.
